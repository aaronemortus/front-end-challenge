# JÃ¼sto Front-end Challenge

### Requirements
* Node 16
* Sass 1.43.4

### Getting started
The project is already built in the main.js file and you can just start a simple server to display the index.html file
e.g. ```http-server ```

### Or
For first time to run on development mode:

```npm i```

If node dependecies are installed, just run:

`npm run dev`

### Sass

Ensure Sass is installed

`npm i -g sass`

and run the Sass server

`cd static/css && sass --watch global.scss global.css`

If the installation is done, just start a simple server to display the index file.
